# README #

This Toolbox is build for 3D correlative microscopy. It helps with 3D to 2D correlation of three dimensional confocal image stacks to two dimensional SEM/FIB dual beam microscope images. Though it is not limited to that.

The 3D Correlation Toolbox was developed at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Department of Molecular Structural Biology on the basis of the paper [Site-Specific Cryo-focused Ion Beam Sample Preparation Guided by 3D Correlative Microscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2015.10.053). 3DCT uses code from 3D rigid transformation from [Pyto](https://github.com/vladanl/Pyto.git).

Further information can be found on [http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/rd/baumeister](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/rd/baumeister) and [http://3dct.semper.space](http://3dct.semper.space)

The Toolbox is written in Python 2.7 and comes with a PyQt4 GUI. Further dependencies as of now are:

* PyQt4 [^1]
+ numpy [^2]
+ scipy [^2]
+ matplotlib [^2]
+ opencv [^1]
+ cv2 [^2]
+ tifffile 0.9.2 [^2]  (Christoph Gohlke)
+ colorama [^2]  (optional for colored stdout when debugging)
+ qimage2ndarray [^2]

[^1]: usually available via your favorite package manager
[^2]: available via pip

### Version ###

Version 2.0 is the first public release and received a revised GUI and image stack handling (reslicing) done in python (formerly outsourced to FIJI)

Most recent stable release version is 2.4.0.

### Binaries ###

There are [Pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org) binaries available for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux (built under Ubuntu 15.04) at [http://3dct.semper.space/](http://3dct.semper.space/#download)

### Citing ###

We ask users to cite:

* The general [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2015.10.053) that forms the basis of the 3D Correlation Toolbox
+ When using independent modules/scripts from the source code, any [specific](http://3dct.semper.space/documentation.html#citable) publications of modules/scripts used in this software
+ Check the header of the module/script in question for more detailed information

If journal reference limits interfere, the module/script-specific publications should take precedence.

In general, please cite this project and the modules/scripts used in it.

Thank you for your support!
